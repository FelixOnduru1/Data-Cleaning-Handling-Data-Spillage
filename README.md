# Data-Cleaning-Handling-Data-Spillage
 A situation may arise where the data you want to analyze has some of its columns spilling into others rendering the data unusable.

By grouping, creating subsets, cleaning the subsets and concatenating the subsets, I achieve a final csv dataset that can be analyzed without the initial trouble.
